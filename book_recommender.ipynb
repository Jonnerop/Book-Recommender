    "The goal of the project is to make a book recommender with **Singular Value Decomposition** (**SVD**) algorithm, a collaborative filtering technique based on matrix factorization. The work is based on two datasets, one that contains user book rating pairs and another with book metadata such as title, author, and genre. The aim of the project is to train a recommendation model that can predict a user's rating for a book and give book suggestions.\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "The question the project is trying to answer is:\n",
    "> Can a collaborative filtering model based on SVD accurately predict a user's rating for a book they have not read, and how well can it recommend books that align with the user's preferences?\n",
    "\n",
    "This question guides the project work through data exploration, model training, and evaluation with the goal of improving personalized recommendations on platforms used to help users discover books.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main requirement is to build and evaluate a recommendation model that can do accurate predictions of ratings and also produce best book suggestions for users. A constraint is that the dataset is very large, which makes it more challenging to handle effectively due to computational costs and the high sparsity of user-book ratings that limits the data density for the model training. The expected outcome is a validated book recommender that can give accurate predictions, relevant book recommendations, and potentially reveal patterns in user reading preferences."

    "Initially, a **k-Nearest Neighbors** (kNN) based collaborative filtering algorithm was implemented (KNNBasic from scikit-surprise). However, the model ran into memory issues during training. This happened because **kNN-recommenders** compute and store a full similarity matrix between all users. With a dataset as large as the one used in this project, the matrix becomes extremely large and requires more memory than is available. To address this, the kNN algorithm was replaced with **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**, which is more memory efficient and scales better to large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Singular value decomposition (SVD) is a **collaborative filtering algorithm** that **decomposes the user-item (user-book) rating matrix into three lower-dimensional matrices**: user features, item features, and singular values. User features capture latent factors representing user preferences, item features capture latent factors representing item characteristics, and singular values indicate the importance of each latent factor. By reducing the dimensionality of the data, SVD can generalize better to the user-item pairs to be predicted as well as make accurate predictions even with sparse data. For this reason, it also works well with large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decomposition captures **latent factors** that explain user preferences and item characteristics. In the real world, these factors could represent genres, themes, or styles that influence each user's ratings. They are however not directly interpretable as the ratings dataset consists of only user IDs, book IDs, and ratings without any additional metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of latent factors is a **hyperparameter k (`n_factors`)** that can be tuned to optimize performance. More factors can capture more complex patterns but may lead to overfitting, while fewer factors may underfit the data. The SVD algorithm learns these latent factors by minimizing the error between predicted and actual ratings in the training set using stochastic gradient descent. In practise, the algorithm iterates over the training data multiple times (`n_epochs`, where default  is 20 times), updating the latent factor matrices to reduce the prediction error.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The final prediction for a user-item pair is computed as the dot product** of the corresponding user and item latent factor vectors, plus any bias terms. These bias terms account for systematic tendencies of users to rate higher or lower than average, and items to receive higher or lower ratings than average. Finally, the predicted rating is converted to the provided rating range (1-5 in this case)."

    "In the context of a 1–5 rating scale, what is considered an *acceptable* level of accuracy depends on factors such as data sparsity (which in this data is high), inherent noise in the dataset, and the specific domain of application. Baseline models that rely on simple predictors, such as global, user, or item means, typically achieve RMSE values in the range of 0.95 to 1.15 and MAE values between 0.70 and 0.85. With SVD, the model generally performs better on sparse public datasets, often reaching RMSE values around 0.80 to 0.90 and MAE values around 0.60 to 0.70.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given these benchmarks, the obtained results of **RMSE 0.83** and **MAE 0.64** can be considered **solid and well within the \"good\" range**, especially considering the sparsity of the dataset. This indicates that the model captures meaningful patterns in user preferences and produces predictions that are generally accurate."

    "The model can give useful and relevant book recommendations, but there is still room for improvement. One possible enhancement would be **hyperparameter tuning**, where different values for additional parameters such as `n_epochs` are tested to optimize performance and reduce prediction error. Another issue to consider is the **cold-start problem**, which occurs when new users or books have few or no ratings, leading to less accurate recommendations due to minimal data. Additionally, the model may exhibit a **bias toward popular items**, meaning it could prioritize books with many existing ratings while overlooking less-known titles that might better match individual user preferences."

    "The recommender can now be used to give insightful recommendations to avid bookworms on what they might want to read next, by analyzing user book rating patterns and predicting how much a user would like books they haven’t yet rated. The **SVD algorithm**, which the model is also based on, has been proven to be excellent for recommender systems handling large datasets, making the model more scalable and futureproof, assuming the dataset keeps growing in size with an influx of new users and ratings.\n",

Alternatively, the recommender could be integrated into an already **existing e-commerce or reading platform**. In an application, users could rate books and based on their rating history the application would recommend new books. To make the experience smoother for new users and battle the **cold-start problem**, a default recommender algorithm should be constructed based on e.g. popular or highly rated books.\n",

    "The performance of the recommender should be **monitored over time**, as most of the ratings in the data are very high, which leads the model to predict similarly high ratings.

While the predictions tend to favor higher ratings, the model succeeds in identifying relevant books and demonstrates the potential of SVD for personalized book recommendations."
